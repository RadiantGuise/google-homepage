This is one of the first projects I'm doing as part of The Odin Project. I will be designing a webpage based off of the Google home page.



From The Odin Project's [curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css)


UPDATE: I decided to use this just to get an idea of how the process works. My "final" update leaves much to be desired but I'm happy to move on. I may look back at this project after some more experience to see how differently I can approach it.
